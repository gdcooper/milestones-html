    <h1>Explaining a Snippet</h1>

    <p>On this page, I'm going to be explaining the code behind a link to a website.</p>

    <h2>The Snippet</h2>

    <p>
      Want to search the web?
      Try <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
    </p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>

    <p>If you look at this page using dev tools, you'll see a few different tags. The first is that big tag labeled a. What does it do?

      Answer: It denotes a link. Everything inside this tag tells the computer what this link is, and what to do with it.

      The first bit, href, is simple. It's where the url of the link goes.

      The next bit, the id, is used to identify and style a single bit of code. The id, the-best-link, can only be given to this link, but the-best-link1 could be given to other code.

      The next bit, the class 'banana', is like a blanket id for a bunch of stuff. Everything in that class can be selected or styled using the same code. It's a good idea to use odd class names to make them stick out, and be easier to find in the future.

      Finally, we have the target. The target states where the computer will open the link. The _blank tag tells the computer to open that link in a new window.

      Now you know all about that tag!
