      <h2> A New Tag: The Paragraph</h2>
      <p>
        In HTML, paragraphs are blocks of text typically placed in the 'body' section of the code. They denote the 'body' text of a website, hence the placement.

        A paragraph is used to create easy blocks of text to manipulate and put between headings, and other things like lists or pictures.

        It is denoted in HTML using p.

      <h2>Blockquotes!</h2>
      <p>Blockquotes are used to cite other quotes in a differing format, often focusing on longer quotes and quotes from other websites.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/famous-quotes">
        "Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Pre-Formatted Text</h2>
      <pre>
        This tag, pre, is used to denote pre-formatted text that is already spaced, and will stay at a consistent width and spacing no matter what.
      </pre>

      <h2>Emphasis: The em and i Tags</h2>
      <p>In HTML, there are two different ways to emphasize text. There is the em tag, which looks like this: <em>Shouting is fun!</em></p>

      <p>Then, there is also the i tag, which both emphasizes the text and sets it off from the rest: <i>Shouting is fun!</i></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Bolding: The b and strong Tags</h2>
      <p>There are also ways to bold text, or make it bold. The b tag is stylistic, and makes text bold: <b>Shouting is fun!</b></p>

      <p>However, there is also the strong tag, which was made as part of original html and just makes text stronger than the surroundings: <strong>Shouting is fun!</strong></p>

      <p>This is the same relationship betwen i and em: One was original, intended for function, and the other evolved for style.</p>

      <h2>The Code Tag</h2>
      <p>The 'code' tag embeds code directly in the page to be viewable in a normal browser view. Here is an example of the 'snippet' from another page, displayed in its code:
        Try <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
